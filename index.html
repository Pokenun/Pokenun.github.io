                        Augmented Reality Games for Learning: A Literature Review
                    </div>
                   <div class="intro">
                    Augmented Reality (AR) is the technology that overlaps virtual objects onto the real world objects [1]. It has three main features: the combination of the real world and the virtual world, real-time interaction, and 3D registration [3]. The past few years have witnessed a growing popularity in the research interest for AR since mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets have offered much easier and cheaper access to AR for users than before [1]. Positive effects of AR technology on students’ learning were identified in previous studies in the development of skills and knowledge, enhancement of learning experiences, and improvement of collaborative learning [35]. The use of AR in education could improve the learning efficiency and provide a more fun experience for students [21].

                The features of AR lead to a variety of positive effects on learning. The interactive 3D models in AR can enhance students’ learning experience and collaborative skills; the combination of the real world and the virtual world in AR can support the study of the invisible concept and content; and the rich instructional materials (e.g., text, video, audio, etc.) can attract and immerse students into the learning [35]. In addition to that, some literatures drew attention to the social impacts of AR on students. For instance, the use of AR technology provided more opportunities for students to communicate and collaborate in the real world [20]. The social interactions between students and teachers, students and their parents were also encouraged [33].

Structured literature reviews were found on AR for educational purposes. For example, one systematic review of AR for education investigated 68 AR studies in education and concluded a number of advantages and challenges [1]. In this review, the advantages of AR in educational settings were classified into learner outcomes, pedagogical contributions, interaction, and others. In another review, the definitions, taxonomies, and technologies of AR technology were introduced, and the AR features and their affordances, as well as the solutions for AR challenges, were discovered [35]. Different affordances of location-based AR and image-based AR for science learning were also studied [11]. The review on AR trends in education found the educational field and purposes, target group, advantages, data collection methods, and discussed the trends for AR for educational settings [4].

These literature reviews mainly focused on the advantages and affordances of AR. Moreover, the purposes of using AR were different, such as a practice for lab experiments or an introduction to certain topics [4]. However, the game elements and social factors contained in the AR applications were not addressed enough.
